## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
 The Quiz Game tests your thinking speed. You must answer each question before the timer ends to earn 1 point. If the answer is wrong or time runs out, you lose a point. Thereâ€™s a 3-second pause between questions, and the correct answer is always shown. The game ends with your final score and an option to restart.
